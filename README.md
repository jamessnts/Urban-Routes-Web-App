Project 8 - Automated Testing
This project required students to conduct automated testing on the Urban Routes app through WebdriverIO. 

Technologies used: 
1. WebdriverIO - enables the students to conduct automated browser testing. 
2. Visual Code Studio - enables the students to edit test codes in an easy and organized manner. Built in terminal window also helps in running the tests easier by having it in one application. 
3. GitBash - allows students to clone the repositories. 
4. Inspect Element (DevTools) - allows the students to browse through the DOM (Document Object Model) to determine and pinpoint the website elements. 

Techniques used:
1. Javascript - was used to write the command codes. 
2. Mocha - Describe and It functions were used. 
3. Helper functions - used to generate numbers for testing. 
4. Page Object Model - followed the model to organize the code.
