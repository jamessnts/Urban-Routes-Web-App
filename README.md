Project 8 - Automated Testing
This project required students to conduct automated testing on the Urban Routes app through WebdriverIO. 

Technologies used: 
1. WebdriverIO - enables the students to conduct automated browser testing. 
2. Visual Code Studio - enables the students to edit test codes in an easy and organized manner. Built in terminal window also helps in running the tests easier by having it in one application. 
3. GitBash - allows students to clone the repositories. 
4. Inspect Element (DevTools) - allows the students to browse through the DOM (Document Object Model) to determine and pinpoint the website elements. 

Techniques used:
1. Javascript - was used to write the command codes. 
2. Mocha - Describe and It functions were used. 
3. Helper functions - used to generate numbers for testing. 
4. Page Object Model - followed the model to organize the code. 

How to run the tests:
SET UP
1. Make sure all necessary software is installed. 
2. Clone the repository from Github. 
3. Make necessary changes to some values in the provided files, such as chromedriver version and server address. 
4. Open the terminal and locate your current project folder. 
5. Run the "npm install" command to install al libraries and files needed. 
6. Run an initial test using the "npm run wdio" command.

WRITE YOUR CODE
1. Start writing your test codes. Make sure to follow proper formatting and keep the code as organized and neat as possible. 

RUN YOUR TESTS
1. Before starting to run your test, restarting the server and pasting the new values to your wdio.conf.js file might be necessary. 
2. During testing, you can disable the "headless" feature as well to visually see the testing process. 
3. Run your tests using the "npm run wdio" command. 
4. Fix any errors in case anything pops up and you're all set!
